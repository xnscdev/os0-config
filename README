This repository contains patches and build configuration files for building
the OS/0 operating system and cross-compiling software.

Directory layout:

patches - Contains gzip'd patch files for various software, each file is
	  named in the format <package>-<version>.patch.gz and can be
	  used by entering the source directory for the package and running:

	  gzip -cd <PATCHFILE> | patch -Np1

targets - Contains meson build configuration files for various targets. Use
	  these files to cross-compile the operating system kernel or system
	  libraries when building like this:

	  meson --cross-file=<TARGETFILE>

	  Each target file is named according to the target triplet of the
	  GCC toolchain it will use, for example, i686-pc-os0.conf will try
	  to use a compiler named `i686-pc-os0-gcc'.
